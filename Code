Abstract
This notebook is going to perform Web Scraping, Merging of the various dataframes and perform some regression method on the final dataframe.
In this notebook the following Datasets are uploaded i.e) World population, Gross Domestic Product of World and Carbon dioxide emission all over the world with the following years.
The prediction of emission of carbon dioxide due to increasing population and Gross domestic Product is performed in this notebook. There is research that the increasing population and Gross Domestic Product leads to increasing carbon dioxide (4.1).

Introduction
In todays time the one of the most problematic thing in the world is the increasing pollution and because of that global warming gets triggered. There is a study said to be that the increasing population in the world leads to the increasing temeperature. One of the research alsomentions that because of increasing population the Gross domestic product(GDP) also increases which also leads to the increasing pollution. in this notebook we are going to predict the co2 emisiion i.e growth with the population table and GDP table.
Firstly we are gonna scrap the population website and make a dataframe for number of years. In that dataframe we can see the no of population that is rising year by year in the numeric format.
After that we are going to fetch the data for the gdp from the following URL, where we can see the gdp growth according to the year and the gdp calculation revenue for the number of years of entire world.
The Website that we are going to scrap includes co2 emission table that gives the data of the entire world emission for the following years that are mentioned. From these websites tables we are going to drop the unwanted tables for clear defining and renaming the columns for the better understanding and for easy implementation.

After fetching the need data we are going to merge the dataframe from the 'Year' column so it will be easy to analyze the data as per the year.
we are going to visualize the dataframe in the form of graph so we can get enough information on which data is more related to another data.

The various regression technique is applied to the final dataframe for prediction answer that is R square. R square will be important input that we are going to get after regression technique.

3. Scrapping the world population from the following url.
https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/world-population-by-year/

Below Requesting the website for world population:

url_population = "https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/world-population-by-year/"
response = requests.get(url_population)          # request the website
scraping = BeautifulSoup(response.text,'lxml')
response          # Response should be 200 for prefect implementation
<Response [200]>
From the above code we get the response 200, this means the website request is successfull and we can proceed with our further fetching of the data from the website.

#element = scraping.find("div",attrs = {"class":"content-inner"})                
#element
#print(element.prettify())                  #In BeautifulSoup, the Prettify() method would enable us to show how the tags are nested in the text.
Fetching the title of the Web page

h1 = scraping.find(name='h1') # Find the 'h1' element inside of the 'body' tag
h1
<h1>World Population by Year</h1>
Fetching the data for the world population from the requested URL by selecting the td and attr = style : font-weight: bold; text-align:right

element_population_no = scraping.findAll("td", attrs = {"style" : "font-weight: bold; text-align:right"})
element_population_no[:5]
[<td style="font-weight: bold; text-align:right">7,713,468,100</td>,
 <td style="font-weight: bold; text-align:right">7,631,091,040</td>,
 <td style="font-weight: bold; text-align:right">7,547,858,925</td>,
 <td style="font-weight: bold; text-align:right">7,464,022,049</td>,
 <td style="font-weight: bold; text-align:right">7,379,797,139</td>]
Fetching the data for the Year from the requested URL by selecting the td. The Year table is important is becasue it will be used for the merging in the further code with different dataFrames

element_population_year = scraping.findAll("td")
element_population_year[:5]
[<td>2020</td>,
 <td style="font-weight: bold; text-align :right">7,794,798,739</td>,
 <td style="text-align:right">1.05 %</td>,
 <td style="text-align:right">81,330,639</td>,
 <td style="text-align:right">52</td>]
Now in the further code DATA CLEANING process will be done for the population and YEAR table for better understanding.
For the world_population we will be using .strip method for displaying the clean data.
In below code we are going to separate the column of population of the world

world_population = []

element_population_no
element_population_year


for l in range(len(element_population_no)):
    poplt_1 = element_population_no[l].text.strip()
    poplt_1=poplt_1.replace(',','')                               # Replace tag been used for removing the ',' 
    world_population.append(poplt_1)
    
In the code below we need to separate the YEAR table from other columns because there are many tags are available in td.
To approach this process we will used the multi if condition for separating the YEAR column from Others.

data = []
Year = []

for a in range(len(element_population_year)):
     data.append(element_population_year[a].text.strip())
          
for b in range(len(data)):
    if ',' not in data[b]:
        if '%' not in data[b]:
            if len(data[b]) > 2:
                Year.append(data[b])
Year = Year
Year = Year[1:]

# creating a data frame for scraped data and converting the data type to numeric

    
     
df_1 = pd.DataFrame({'world_population':world_population,'Year':Year})
df_1 = df_1.apply(pd.to_numeric)
print(df_1.iloc[np.r_[0:5]])
   Year  world_population
0  2019        7713468100
1  2018        7631091040
2  2017        7547858925
3  2016        7464022049
4  2015        7379797139
As now we have fetched the required data from the world population Website.
This data wil be used to merged with further dataframe that we are going to create from the further Website i.e) GDP Website


4. Now fetching the data for the Gross Domestic Product by requesting the GDP Website
https://www.worldometers.info/gdp/


4.1) There is research paper for the relationship between GDP and Co2 emission.
This research explores the interaction between the GDP per capita and greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) per capita emissions to analyse the possible effect of economic development on environmental damage.
The research is performed using cross-sectional details on 69 developed nations as well as 45 developing countries. Many studies are being tested, with various perspectives on the possible effect of economic development on environmental deterioration. All studies agree that there is a correlation between economic growth and environmental deterioration, but the effect of this link is different.

Below we can see the research paper.

from IPython.display import IFrame
IFrame(src='http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1076315/FULLTEXT01.pdf', width=600, height=500)

Below Requesting the website for World GDP:

url_population = "https://www.worldometers.info/gdp/"
response = requests.get(url_population)
scraping = BeautifulSoup(response.text,'lxml')
response
<Response [200]>
We get the response 200, this means the website request is successfull and we can proceed with our further fetching of the data from the website.

Below we use .read_html method, this method will directly fetch the entire table of GDP that is required for the Merging.

scraping2 = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "lxml") 
scraping2 = scraping2.find_all("table", "table table-striped table-bordered table-hover table-condensed table-list")# mentioning the tag where table is available and the table name
df = pd.read_html(str(scraping2))                  
gdp = df[0]
gdp = gdp.iloc[:]
gdp[0:8]

pandas.core.frame.DataFrame

4.2) Data wrangling of Gdp table
Renaming the columns and dropping the unwanted coumns for better understanding and for easy Implementation.

gdp.rename(columns ={'GDP Real (Inflation adj.)':'GDP_world', 'GDP growth':'gdp_growth', 'Per Capita': 'gdp_per_capita'},  inplace = True)        # rename the columns
gdp.drop(['GDP Nominal (Current USD)', 'Pop.change', 'World Population'],  axis = 1, inplace = True)   # delete the mentioned columns
gdp.head()
Year	GDP_world	gdp_growth	gdp_per_capita
0	2017	$80,250,107,912,599	3.14%	$10,632
1	2016	$77,796,772,093,915	2.51%	$10,423

4	2013	$71,687,932,799,352	2.62%	$9,942
As per the above code we get the require data for GDP that can be used for merging and for further implementation

Now fetching the data for the co2 emission of the world by requesting the Co2 emission Website
<b>https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/<b>

5. Fetching the Data for the Co2 Emission
https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/
From this Website we are going to fetch the co2 emisiion in tons and required columns for the entire world according to the years mentioned.

Below Requesting the website for Co2 Emission :

url_co2 = "https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/"
response = requests.get(url_co2)
scraping1 = BeautifulSoup(response.text,'lxml')
response
<Response [200]>
We get the response 200, this means the website request is successfull and we can proceed with our further fetching of the data from the website.a

Below we use .read_html method, this method will directly fetch the entire table of GDP that is required for the Merging.

scraping1 = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "lxml") 
scraping1 = scraping1.find_all("div", "table-responsive") # mentioning table name for fetching the table from the website.
df = pd.read_html(str(scraping1))                             
co2_emission = df[0]
co2_emission = co2_emission.iloc[:]
co2_emission.head()
Year	Fossil CO2 Emissions (tons)	CO2 emisions change	CO2 emissions per capita	Population	Pop. change
0	2016	35753305000	0.34%	4.79	7464022049	1.14 %
1	2015	35631078000	-0.16%	4.83	7379797139	1.16 %
2	2014	35686780000	0.76%	4.89	7295290765	1.17 %
3	2013	35416599000	1.80%	4.91	7210581976	1.19 %
4	2012	34790564000	0.61%	4.88	7125828059	1.20 %
Now we have fetch the table from the website, we will apply the process of Data Wrangling for cleaning the data and making data easier to understand and in more readable format .


5.1) Data wrangling of co2 emission table
Renaming the columns and dropping the unwanted coumns for better understanding and for easy Implementation.

co2_emission.rename(columns ={'Fossil CO2 Emissions (tons)':'co2_emission_tons', 'CO2 emisions change':'co2_percentile', 'CO2 emissions per capita': 'co2_percapita'}, inplace = True)
co2_emission.drop(['Population' , 'Pop. change', 'co2_percentile'],  axis = 1, inplace = True)
co2_emission.head()
Year	co2_emission_tons	co2_percapita
0	2016	35753305000	4.79
1	2015	35631078000	4.83
2	2014	35686780000	4.89
3	2013	35416599000	4.91
4	2012	34790564000	4.88
Now we have the required data for co2 emission which can be used for merging with the world population and world Gross Domestic product table.
Now we have all the required data from population, GDP and co2 emission table, now we can perform the merge process in which we will merge the three dataframes in one for further visualization and regression process.
Further now we can proceed the Merging process.


6. Merging the dataframes.
Firstly we will be merging the population and GDP dataframe into one dataframe.
merging = population.merge(GDP table)
we will be merging on the basis of the 'Year' column which is the common column for all the dataframes.

gdp_poplt = df_1.merge(gdp)                             # merging the population dataframe with the gdp dataframe

gdp_poplt['Year'] = gdp_poplt['Year']

print(gdp_poplt[ :5])

print('Population and Gdp dataframe Merged into one Dataframe')
   Year  world_population            GDP_world gdp_growth gdp_per_capita

1  2016        7464022049  $77,796,772,093,915      2.51%        $10,423
2  2015        7379797139  $75,834,189,927,314      2.86%        $10,276
3  2014        7295290765  $73,725,379,037,299      2.86%        $10,106
4  2013        7210581976  $71,687,932,799,352      2.62%         $9,942
Population and Gdp dataframe Merged into one Dataframe
gdp_poplt.head()
Year	world_population	GDP_world	gdp_growth	gdp_per_capita

4	2013	7210581976	$71,687,932,799,352	2.62%	$9,942
Now we will be merging the dataframe that we get from previous merging (population and GDP dataframe on the basis of the 'Year'column) with the co2 emission dataframe.
merging2 = gdp_poplt.merge(co2 emission table)
This dataframe will also display the element according to the 'Year' column

final_table = gdp_poplt.merge(co2_emission)

final_table['Year'] = final_table['Year']

print(final_table[ :5])

print('[Population and Gdp]dataframe Merged with co2 emission dataframe')

7. Applying the regex function
Applying the regex function in the final dataframe for Cleaning the data

f = final_table.replace('%', '', regex = True) 
final = f.replace(',', '', regex = True) 

final['GDP_world'] = final['GDP_world'].str.replace(r'\D', '').astype(float)                      ###  Removing $ from column
final['gdp_per_capita'] = final['gdp_per_capita'].str.replace(r'\D', '').astype(float)                ###  Removing $ from column

Conclusion:
In this notebook we applied many function starting from scratching the several websites to merging the Dataframes and applying functions like Regex and Data Wrangling for getting Clean data and in more understandable way. After creating the Final Dataframe we perform some regression functions on the final dataframe, In which we try to predict the co2 emission from world population and Gdp Growth of the world.
In linear regression we get result for population and GDp in which it shows the higher co2 emission for Gdp rather than Population by assuming the value of the R^2.
While for Polynomial it is quite difficult to undertand the graph.
Co2 emission is one of the biggest concern these days, solution after these to control the population which can lead to gdp control, less industrial construction, less automobiles and there are many more things. If some of these can come under control then the co2 emisssion will decrease followed by Global Warming.
